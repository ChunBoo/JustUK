'''
Given an integer array nums, return the number of subarrays filled with 0.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

Â 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
There are 4 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
There are 2 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 2 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 6.
