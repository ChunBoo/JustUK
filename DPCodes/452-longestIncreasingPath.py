"""
 a two-dimensional integer matrix, find the length of the longest strictly increasing path. You can move up, down, left, or right.

Constraints1
n, m â‰¤ 500 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in matrix
Example 1
Input

1
2
3
4
5
matrix = [
    [1, 3, 5],
    [0, 4, 6],
    [2, 2, 9]
]
Output
6

Explanation
The longest path is [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9]

Due to the strictly increasing condition, there cannot be any cycles
Question yourself on what will be the longest increasing path if I start from each cell (consider each cell as a starting point and traverse)
Keep a track of the longest increasing path from each cell. Compute this value once and use it whenever required.
