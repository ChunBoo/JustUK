"""_summary_
You are given a list of integers nums. Return the length of the longest sublist such that its length is at least 3 
and its values are strictly increasing and then decreasing. Both the increasing part and the decreasing part 
must be non-empty.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [7, 1, 3, 5, 2, 0]
Output
5
Explanation
The sublist [1, 3, 5, 2, 0] is strictly increasing then decreasing.

Example 2
Input
nums = [1, 2, 3]
Output
0
